"Hello Golden Huang! You mentioned that you have no specific strengths, weaknesses, interests, or learning style noted, nor a defined long-term goal, and that you are in grade 10. I will create detailed weekly quest instructions and grading rubrics based on your grade and the typical Pre-Calculus curriculum in the files you uploaded. The instructions will ensure clear expectations, cover the skills/topics taught, help you practice and master the required skills, and be flexible to accommodate a general learner without specified preferences.\n\nFrom the files, the curriculum focuses on units such as functions, polynomial and rational functions, trigonometry (unit circle, trig functions, inverse trig), exponential and logarithmic functions, sequences and series, probability, matrices, vectors, and conic sections.\n\n---\n\n### Week 1 Quest: Introduction to Functions and Lines in the Plane\n\n**Skills & Topics Covered:**\n- Understanding lines in the plane: slope, intercepts, equations of lines.\n- Introduction to functions: definition, notation, domain, range.\n- Graphing simple functions.\n\n**Quest Instructions:**\n1. Review the lesson *1.1 Lines in the Plane* and the notes on *1.2 Functions*.\n2. Complete exercise problems involving:\n   - Finding slope and intercepts from an equation.\n   - Graphing lines and identifying function properties.\n3. Practice writing function notation and evaluating functions for given inputs.\n4. Create 3 example problems of lines and functions, solve them, and explain the steps verbally or in writing.\n\n**Grading Rubric:**\n- **Accuracy (40%)**: Correctly find slopes, intercepts, and graph lines.\n- **Understanding (30%)**: Demonstrate comprehension of functions (domain, range, notation).\n- **Explanation (20%)**: Quality and clarity in explaining example problems.\n- **Completion & Neatness (10%)**: All parts complete and work is organized.\n\n---\n\n### Week 2 Quest: Polynomial Functions and Quadratics\n\n**Skills & Topics Covered:**\n- Polynomial functions: degrees, leading terms.\n- Quadratic functions: standard form, vertex, graphing.\n\n**Quest Instructions:**\n1. Study files on *2.1 Quadratic Functions* and *2.2 Polynomial Functions of Higher Degree*.\n2. Identify polynomial functions by degree and lead coefficient.\n3. Complete practice problems graphing quadratic functions and finding vertices.\n4. Use a graphing tool or draw by hand to show the shape of quadratic functions.\n5. Write a short summary of how polynomial degree affects graph shape.\n\n**Grading Rubric:**\n- **Accuracy (50%)**: Correctly complete problems and graphs.\n- **Conceptual Understanding (30%)**: Explain how degree affects polynomial shape.\n- **Presentation (10%)**: Graphs clear and well-labeled.\n- **Effort & Completion (10%)**: Attempts made for all exercises.\n\n---\n\n### Week 3 Quest: Trigonometry - Unit Circle and Radian Measure\n\n**Skills & Topics Covered:**\n- Unit circle definitions.\n- Angles in degrees and radians.\n- Basic sine, cosine, and tangent values on the unit circle.\n\n**Quest Instructions:**\n1. Review *4.1 Radian & Degree* and *4.2 The Unit Circle* slides.\n2. Memorize the key angles and their radian equivalents.\n3. Complete problems calculating sine, cosine, and tangent for different angles.\n4. Draw a unit circle and label essential angles with coordinates.\n5. Write 5 real-life application examples of using radians or the unit circle.\n\n**Grading Rubric:**\n- **Correctness (40%)**: Accurately find trig values.\n- **Visual Representation (30%)**: Neat and accurate labeled unit circle.\n- **Applications (20%)**: Creativity and relevance of example uses.\n- **Completion (10%)**: All tasks done on time.\n\n---\n\n### Week 4 Quest: Exponential and Logarithmic Functions\n\n**Skills & Topics Covered:**\n- Understanding exponential functions.\n- Logarithmic functions and properties.\n- Solving exponential and logarithmic equations.\n\n**Quest Instructions:**\n1. Study *3.1 Exponential Functions* and *3.2 Logarithmic Functions and Graphs*.\n2. Practice rewriting exponential equations in logarithmic form and vice versa.\n3. Solve given equations involving exponentials and logs.\n4. Summarize the real-world importance of exponential/logarithmic functions (e.g., population growth).\n5. Create graph sketches of exponential growth and decay.\n\n**Grading Rubric:**\n- **Problem Solving (50%)**: Correct solutions to equations.\n- **Concept Explanation (25%)**: Clear summary of uses.\n- **Graphs (15%)**: Accurate and labeled sketches.\n- **Completeness (10%)**: All assigned problems attempted.\n\n---\n\n### Accommodations \n\nSince your learning style and interests are unspecified, I suggest a mixed approach:\n- Visual: Make graphs and diagrams.\n- Verbal: Write explanations or summarize concepts.\n- Hands-on: Create example problems yourself.\n- Reflective: Include real-world applications.\n\n---\n\nIf you can specify your learning preferences or interests later, I can tailor the quests more specifically.\n\nWould you like me to continue with further weeks or customize any quest differently?"
