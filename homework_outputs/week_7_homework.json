"Hello Golden Huang! Since you mentioned you don\u2019t have specific declared strengths, weaknesses, interests, or a preferred learning style, and your long-term goal is blank, I will prepare detailed weekly quest instructions and grading rubrics focusing on the fundamental skills and topics from your 10th-grade pre-calculus class to help you master the subject confidently.\n\nI have reviewed the curriculum materials related to your grade 10 pre-calculus course covering topics including polynomial functions, vectors in space, trigonometric identities, exponential and logarithmic functions, and more. Below is a structured plan for your weekly quests with detailed instructions and rubrics tailored to help you with clear expectations and mastery practice.
