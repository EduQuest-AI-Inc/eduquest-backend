"Hello Golden Huang! Since you mentioned your strengths, weaknesses, interests, and learning style are unspecified, and your long-term goal is also empty, I'll prepare detailed weekly quest instructions and grading rubrics that are clear, structured, and focused on key skills typical for a grade 10 student in the curriculum I have found (which covers pre-calculus topics).\n\nFrom the file contents, it appears the course covers pre-calculus units such as:\n- Functions, Graphs, and their combinations (Unit 1)\n- Quadratic Functions and Polynomial behavior (Unit 2)\n- Exponential and Logarithmic Functions (Unit 3)\n- Trigonometry including unit circle and trig functions (Unit 4)\n- Identities and Equations (Unit 5)\n- Complex numbers and rational functions (Unit 2 content overlaps)\n- Sequences, series, and probability (Unit 8)\n- Vectors in space and 3D coordinate systems (Unit 10)\nand more.\n\nI will outline weekly quests in a five-week sequence as an example, including for each:\n1. Detailed instructions aligned with weekly topics/skills.\n2. A simple grading rubric breaking down expectations and criteria.\n3. Accommodations for unknown learning style/interest by keeping tasks varied and clear.\n4.

Also, if you set a long-term goal (e.g., STEM college, engineering, data science), I can align quests more with those skills.\n\nWould you like me to prepare more weeks or focus on a particular unit or style?"
