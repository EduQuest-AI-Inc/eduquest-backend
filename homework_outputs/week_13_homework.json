"Hello Golden Huang! Since you mentioned that your strengths, weaknesses, interests, and learning style are not identified yet, I will design the weekly quests with clear instructions and a rubric that is flexible and supportive for all learners at grade 10 level, focusing on mastery of topics and skills typically covered in your math curriculum based on the materials I found.\n\nBelow, you will find detailed weekly quests instructions along with grading rubrics aligned with skills and topics taught. These follow a progression typical for Grade 10 Precalculus or similar math curriculum. Each week focuses on a main topic or skill area. If you want, you can share later more about your preferences and I can tailor further!\n\n---\n\n### Week 1: Quadratic Functions (Based on \"2.1 Quadratic Functions.ppt.pptx\")\n\n**Objective:**  \nUnderstand the standard form of quadratic functions, graph parabolas, identify vertex, and find maximum or minimum values.\n\n**Instructions:**  \n1.
