"Hello Golden Huang! Since you didn't specify strengths, weaknesses, interests, or learning style, I will provide detailed instructions and grading rubrics for each weekly quest based purely on the grade 10 pre-calculus curriculum material I found in the files you uploaded. If you'd like, you can share your preferred learning style or interests later, and I can personalize the instructions further.\n\nI'll provide a general structure of instructions and grading rubric for each week aligned with the pre-calculus topics in this curriculum.
