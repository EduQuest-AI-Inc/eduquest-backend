"Hello Golden Huang! Since you noted \"None\" for strengths, weaknesses, interests, and learning style, and your long-term goal is blank, I'll provide a general yet detailed approach for your grade 10 weekly quests. The goal is clear expectations, alignment with grade 10 topics (primarily precalculus), and an inclusive rubric to help you master the skills.\n\nHere is a template structure with detailed instructions and a grading rubric for weekly quests. The content corresponds with common Grade 10 precalculus topics, including sequences and series, trig functions, vectors, and graphing, as indicated in the provided material.\n\n---\n\n## Weekly Quest Instructions and Grading Rubric Template for Grade 10 Precalculus\n\n---\n\n### Week [X] Quest Title: [Topic]  \nE.g., Week 8: Sequences and Series\n\n### Objective  \nUnderstand and master the concepts of [topic], including key definitions, problem-solving, and application to real-world examples.\n\n---\n\n### Instructions  \n\n1. **Review Materials**  \n   - Go through the corresponding slideshow or notebook for the unit, e.g., \"8.1 Sequences & Series\" PPT and student slides.\n   - Focus on definitions, formulas, and example problems.\n   - Watch any available videos or online tutorials linked by your teacher.\n\n2. **Practice Problems**  \n   - Complete all assigned problems in the quest worksheet or online platform.\n   - Show all work clearly; explain each step in solving problems such as arithmetic sequences, geometric sequences, or probability, depending on the week.\n   - For graphical topics, draw clean, labeled graphs with correct scales.\n\n3. **Apply Concepts**  \n   - Relate the concepts to real-life scenarios when possible (e.g., geometric sequences to population growth).\n   - If the quest involves vectors (as seen in units on vectors in space and cross product), visualize vectors in 3D and perform calculations as instructed.\n\n4. **Reflection**  \n   - Write 2-3 sentences about what you found challenging and how you overcame it.\n   - Suggest one question or application you'd like to explore further.\n\n---\n\n### Grading Rubric  \n\n| Criteria                   | Excellent (90-100%)                          | Good (75-89%)                                | Needs Improvement (50-74%)                | Incomplete (<50%)                        |\n|----------------------------|---------------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|\n| **Accuracy of Solutions**  | All answers correct with clear, logical steps | Mostly correct with minor errors               | Several mistakes, unclear or incomplete steps | Many incorrect answers or missing work  |\n| **Understanding & Explanation** | Explanations show deep understanding; clear and thorough | Explanations mostly clear, but some gaps       | Explanations are minimal or confusing       | No explanations or incorrect reasoning  |\n| **Presentation & Neatness**| Work is organized, neat, graphs neatly drawn and labeled | Mostly organized, minor presentation issues    | Some disorganization or sloppy work         | Disorganized, illegible, or incomplete work |\n| **Application & Reflection** | Thoughtful reflection and real-world application | Basic reflection, some application attempt     | Minimal reflection or application            | No reflection or application             |\n| **On-time Submission**     | Submitted by due date                        | Submitted with minor delay                      | Submitted late with significant delay        | Not submitted                            |\n\n---\n\n### Accommodation Notes  \n\n- Since strengths/weaknesses/interests/learning style are unavailable, instructions focus on clear, step-by-step learning combined with reflection to develop meta-cognitive skills.\n- Encourage use of visual aids when helpful, especially for geometric and vector concepts.\n- Include opportunities to relate abstract concepts to tangible examples.\n\n---\n\n### Example Detailed Weekly Quest: Week 8 \u2014 Arithmetic and Geometric Sequences\n\n#### Instructions\n\n1. Review slides \"8.2 Arithmetic Sequences\" and \"8.3 Geometric Sequences\" (student versions for examples and terminology).  \n2. Complete the following problems:  \n   - Find the 10th term of the arithmetic sequence {3, 7, 11, ...}  \n   - Sum the first 20 terms of the geometric sequence {2, 6, 18, ...}  \n   - Write a real-world example of where a geometric sequence might apply.  \n3. Draw a graph demonstrating how the sequence grows over its terms.  \n4. Reflect on which sequence type is easier to understand and why.\n\n#### Grading\n\nUse rubric above, emphasizing accuracy of formula usage, completeness of work, and quality of reflection.\n\n---\n\nIf you provide your learning style, interests, or long-term goals later, I can customize these instructions and rubrics further (e.g., incorporating project-based learning, interactive tools, or interest-based examples).\n\nWould you like me to prepare detailed weekly quests for the full schedule you have, or start with a few specific weeks? Please also share if you prefer any particular learning style accommodated (visual, hands-on, reading/writing, etc.) or any interests you have.\n\n---\n\n### Summary\n\n- Each weekly quest focuses on the week\u2019s topics from your curriculum (like sequences, vectors, trigonometry, etc.)\n- Instructions include review, practice, application, and reflection\n- The rubric provides transparent grading criteria aligned with skills\n- Flexible to refine based on your preferred learning approach\n\nI\u2019m here to help you master your Grade 10 math journey!
