"Hello Golden Huang! Since you currently have \"None\" listed for your strengths, weaknesses, interests, and learning style, and no long-term goal specified, I will provide detailed, clear, and structured instructions and grading rubrics for each weekly quest tailored broadly for a Grade 10 Pre-Calculus or similar level course. The instructions will align with the topics and skills commonly taught weekly in Grade 10 math such as functions, trigonometry, sequences, probability, and vectors.\n\nBased on the syllabus content files you uploaded (mostly related to Pre-Calculus topics in progressive units), I will draft detailed quest instructions and grading rubrics for some representative weekly topics, assuming a sequential approach. If you prefer, you can provide your learning style or long-term goals later for more personalized adjustments.\n\n---\n\n### Week 1: Functions and Graphs (Unit 1 Topics)\n#### Quest Instructions:\n- Study the lessons on Lines in the Plane, Functions, Graphs of Functions, Shifting Graphs, Combinations of Functions, and Inverse Functions.\n- Complete problems that involve:\n  - Identifying and graphing linear functions and their shifts.\n  - Combining two or more functions (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division).\n  - Finding and understanding inverse functions.\n- Use visual aids and graphing calculators to explore how graphs change with different parameters.\n- Create a summary chart with types of functions and their characteristics.\n\n#### Grading Rubric:\n| Criteria                    | Excellent (4)                                         | Good (3)                                           | Fair (2)                                         | Needs Improvement (1)                           |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Accuracy                    | All functions and graphs correctly identified and graphed | Most functions and graphs correct with minor errors | Some correct, some with errors                     | Many incorrect or missing graphs                  |\n| Understanding               | Clear explanation and correct use of inverse and combinations | Mostly clear explanation, minor misunderstandings  | Some misunderstandings about function concepts    | Little to no understanding demonstrated           |\n| Presentation & Neatness      | Clear, organized summary chart and work              | Summary and work mostly clear and organized         | Some disorganization, hard to follow                | Work is unclear or disorganized                     |\n| Effort & Completion          | All assigned problems completed                       | Most problems completed                              | Some problems incomplete                            | Many problems incomplete                             |\n\n---\n\n### Week 2: Quadratic and Polynomial Functions (Unit 2)\n#### Quest Instructions:\n- Review material on Quadratic Functions, Polynomial Functions of Higher Degree, Zeros of Polynomials, Complex Numbers, and Fundamental Theorem of Algebra.\n- Complete practice problems to:\n  - Graph quadratic functions and deduce vertex, axis of symmetry.\n  - Find zeros/roots of polynomial functions both algebraically and graphically.\n  - Understand and perform basic operations with complex numbers.\n- Include a short explanation on identifying polynomial degrees and behavior.\n- Optional: Use graphing software to visualize polynomial graphs.\n\n#### Grading Rubric:\n| Criteria                    | Excellent (4)                                         | Good (3)                                           | Fair (2)                                         | Needs Improvement (1)                           |\n|-----------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------|\n| Accuracy                    | All polynomial properties, zeros, and graph components accurate | Minor errors in finding zeros or graph details    | Some errors in algebraic or graphical aspects     | Major errors or incomplete solutions               |\n| Conceptual Understanding    | Clearly explains polynomial behavior and complex number usage | Adequate explanations with minor gaps              | Partial understanding evident                      | Little to no understanding demonstrated           |\n| Presentation & Neatness      | Work clearly laid out, labeled and easy to follow   | Mostly clear with some disorganization              | Somewhat hard to follow                             | Unclear or messy work                               |\n| Effort & Completion          | All assigned tasks and problems completed            | Most problems completed                             | Several problems missing                            | Many tasks left incomplete                          |\n\n---\n\n### Week 3: Trigonometry Basics (Unit 4 & 5)\n#### Quest Instructions:\n- Engage with lessons on Radian & Degree, Unit Circle, Right Triangle Trigonometry, Trigonometric Functions, and their Graphs.\n- Complete exercises to:\n  - Convert between radians and degrees.\n  - Understand and use the unit circle for sine, cosine, tangent values.\n  - Solve right triangle problems using trig ratios.\n  - Graph sine and cosine functions, including amplitude, period, and phase shifts.\n- Use diagrams and visual aids to strengthen conceptual understanding.
